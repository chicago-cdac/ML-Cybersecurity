    "Once you have anaconda installed, you want to get either the [Jupyter Lab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), or the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html). Typically, you can simply run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install jupyter\n",

    "For plotting modules such as numpy and matplotlib, simply follow the [instructions (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy/). With anaconda, it should be something like:\n",

    "First, open a jupyter lab (just type jupyter lab in the command line and open the link that appears) . You can also run the code directly in Python or IPython but it's not as nice. Generally, if you are not already familiar with jupyter lab or jupyter notebook, I recommend you spend a little time exploring as it's a very useful tool, especially for data science.\n",
