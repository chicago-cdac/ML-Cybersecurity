Typically, you can simply run:\n","```bash\n","conda install jupyter\n","```\n","\n","\n","For plotting modules such as numpy and matplotlib, simply follow the [instructions (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy/). With anaconda, it should be something like:\n","```bash\n","conda install -c anaconda numpy\n","conda install -c anaconda matplotlib\n","```\n","\n","You can install Scikit-Learn using pip. In the command line, just type:\n","```bash\n","pip install scikit-learn\n","```\n","\n","# Checking you have the correct versions of the required libraries\n","First, open a jupyter lab (just type jupyter lab in the command line and open the link that appears) . You can also run the code directly in Python or IPython but it's not as nice. Generally, if you are not already familiar with jupyter lab or jupyter notebook, I recommend you spend a little time exploring as it's a very useful tool, especially for data science.\n","\n","To check you have all you need, you can run the following:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"uUyUJEsSZ8yD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1616609063887,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":823,"user":{"displayName":"Yuxin Chen","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgUZe6Y1eYuyXHXt8_5vwP96FaUx5UTeaBrXUvOdA=s64","userId":"17056023168392975737"}}},"source":["# General math and plotting modules.\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap\n","\n","from scipy import stats\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import sklearn\n","\n","# For profiling the code\n","import time"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_PMSIPpZaHrI"},"source":["The above is a \"minimal\" set of toolkits for building ML models based on the popular python packages.
