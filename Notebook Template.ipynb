    "Notebook introduction, giving an overview and describing how to use the notebook. When possible, introduce connective tissue by gesturing backwards to the videos or earlier modules, or forwards to the live sessions or later modules--e.g., \"in an earlier video in this module, we gave an overview of how ML can be used for anomaly detection. In this notebook, you will see how to implement such methods using real-world data.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics to consider addressing:\n",
    "- How does this notebook relate to the other learning materials?\n",
    "- What will learners be doing with it--is it purely for self-study, or will it come up in a breakout during the live sessions?\n",
    "- Are there any professionally relevant use cases? Or, clarify if the point of a notebook is to show how an algorithm or process works under the hood, rather than how learners might apply that algorithm or process professionally.\n",
    "- Expected time committment. Some basic langauge is below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Time Commitment**: X minutes/hours. Don't spend significantly more time than this going through this notebook. We will have time to briefly review it and take questions during the live sessions."

    "You may divide your notebook into subsections and sub-subsections for readability and interpretability. It's a good idea to provide some context at least for each major code chunk. That may mean introducing the code and describing how it fits into the overall process. Or, it may mean telling learners who to do with it--for example, encouraging them to adjust certain parameters to see how they affect the output, insert or remove snippets, etc."
